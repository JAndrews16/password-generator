# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I designed this application to randonly generate secure passwords that meet certain criteria as defined by the user.

This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The password length is determined by the user but must be within 8-128 characters. The user also has the choice to include: uppercase letters, lowercase letter, numbers, and special characters.
